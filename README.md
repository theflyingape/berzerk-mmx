Commodore VIC20: a popular retroarcade clone using modern 6502 assembler

It is based on the 1980 Stern hit, Berzerk.  It did not take a span of 24-years 
to complete like Quikman possessed me, just a mere couple of months between 
commuter rail rides and some weekend tinkering.  Still, it came out pretty good 
because of my improved software sprite stack and floor generator.
